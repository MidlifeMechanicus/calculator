This is is a calculator project for the Odin Project Foundations course. The parameters for the calculator can be found here: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator.

Project required features:
-add, subtract, divide and multiply functions
-only deals with two numbers at a time
-defaults to useing the result of previous calcultion as start of subsequent calculation
-rounds to two decimal places to prevent overflow
-pressing 'Clear' resets existing data
-snarky error alert on divide by zero

Extra credit features:
-decimal button
-backspace button
-keyboard support

Other features (because I wanted to):

I also made the web page reactive; once the viewport width drops below 600px, the calculator becomes smaller, as do the fonts, and the layout of the header changes slightly.

-calculator becomes smaller at a screen width of less than 600px to accomodate mobile browsers
-layout of header also changes slightly 
number cap?
theme change?
screen adjust?
cannot deliberately divide by zero

Thoughts on html and css layout:

I am a web developer, not a web designer. I have no interest in being a web designer. Clean, simple layouts with decent color matching are as far as I go on my own. I am more than happy to implement other people's amazing ideas, though!
